## What is Mozart++
Mozart++ is a cross-platform template library written in Modern C++ designed to make up for essential but missing components in STL.

Mozart++ was born in our daily development. We usually build all kinds of "wheels" in a project, but the process is just so trivial, as a result, we decided to put these "wheels" out as a separate template library.

Currently our project is written in C++14 because our main project which Mozart++ originally aimed to support was written in C++14.

This project was forked from [libmozart](https://github.com/libmozart) and maintained by Chengdu Covariant Technologies Co., LTD.

Mozart++ Logo was designed by [Michael Lee](https://github.com/mikecovlee).
